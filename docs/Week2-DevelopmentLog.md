## Architecture

TODO(telpirion): Insert architectural diagram

+ **Presentation tier**: Bulma, plain-old JS, Firebase auth
+ **Application tier**: Go, Gin templates, Vertex AI model, Cloud Logging
+ **Data tier**: Firestore

## Objectives

For this week's activities, we need to accomplish the following:

- [x] Extend app to connect to a Gemini endpoint instead of a Gemma endpoint.

   _I've integrated Gemini 1.5 Flash into the app._

- [x] Add version control for prompts. 

   _I have moved prompts out into their own, version-controlled files_

- [ ] Select version of prompt based upon model being called.
- [ ] Experiment with prompting strategies to evaluate outcomes.
- [ ] Provide feedback mechanism for users to rate responses.
- [ ] Track user feedback across sessions and users.
- [ ] Tag user feedback with model type, endpoint ID, prompt

## Moving prompts to their own templates

## Refactoring UI to allow user ratings, model selection toggle, progress bar

My piecemeal approach to frontend development for this project makes me appreciate
frontend frameworks more. It is difficult to keep track of which HTML templates
go with what JS scripts.

The material symbols docs need to
EMPHASIZE that the order of icons must be alphabetically sorted!

CONTINUOUS running out of memory errors with Cloud Shell. I wish I could just set
a checkbox somewhere that cleans up the cache every time I close the window!

```sh
du -hs $(ls -A)
go clean --cache
go clean -modcache
```

Being able to debug server-side AND client-side code in the same interface is AWESOME.
