    "For this week's activities, we must do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Set up an evaluation pipeline to compare Gemini, Gemma, and/or tuned model.\n",
    "- [ ] Export evaluation to a \"table\" (BQ?).\n",
    "- [ ] Set up a rapid evaluation pipeline to see the specific performance of a model.\n",

    "Nice to haves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Limit context passed to Gemma model based upon token count\n",

Though it doesn't provide destination suggestions, it's on the way to do so after collecting the necessary information. Therefore, the response is helpful and performing well on the open_domain criterion. Since the AI is in the middle of the conversation and hasn't provided any suggestions yet, it's premature to assess its performance regarding closed_domain. Hence, it currently fulfills the open_domain requirement and shows a strong trajectory for closed_domain, leading to an interim score of 0.5. However, if we consider that a complete response would consist of providing relevant suggestions, the current response hasn't reached that stage. Hence, it can be interpreted as falling short on the closed_domain criterion.  As the response is helpful and clarifies the user's request, making it aligned with the open_domain criterion. Overall, it balances both by providing a helpful response and a pathway to fulfilling the query on historical sites, leading to an evaluation of 0.5 based on the current state of the conversation.   \n",

The AI should be responding in a way that provides information related to ancient ruins.\\nSTEP 2: The response starts by acknowledging the prompt and proceeds by asking clarifying questions. It has a clear beginning, but the questions do not directly satisfy the user prompt.\\nSTEP 3: Each paragraph is coherent within itself. However, the response as a whole does not relate back to the user's prompt other than an opening acknowledgement.\\nSTEP 4: The questions posed are understandable and relevant to the prompt's main topic. \\nSTEP 5: The response uses clear language and avoids ambiguity.\\nOverall, the response is incoherent. It acknowledges the prompt, then derails to asking the user questions rather than responding to the implicit request of the prompt: Tell me something about the ancient ruins in Greece.   \n",
      "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 STEP 1: The purpose of the prompt is to seek assistance in planning a trip to Japan. The intended audience is someone who is planning a trip to Japan and needs help with the details.\\nSTEP 2: The AI response presents a globally coherent structure. It starts by acknowledging the request, follows with a series of questions to gather essential information for planning, and finally outlines how this information will be used to tailor a detailed plan.\\nSTEP 3: Each point flows logically into the next. The response uses bullet points to divide the questions into two main categories (About You and About Your Trip), making it easy to read and understand.\\nSTEP 4: The response effectively uses parallelisms in the phrasing of the questions (e.g., \"When are you traveling? How long will you be in Japan?\"). This enhances readability and reinforces the overall structure.\\nSTEP 5: No pronouns or references are used in a way that causes confusion.   \n",
      "2  STEP 1: The purpose of the response is to provide information to a user who is planning a trip to the Yucatan Peninsula. The intended audience is someone interested in traveling to this region.\\nSTEP 2: The response exhibits a globally coherent structure. It effectively categorizes information into sections like \"Ancient Maya Sites,\" \"Natural Wonders,\" \"Cultural Experiences,\" and \"Things to do.\" This organization allows the reader to easily navigate through different aspects of the Yucatan Peninsula's attractions.\\nSTEP 3: Locally, the coherence is maintained within each section. The bullet points under each category list specific examples relevant to the category's title. The transitions between sections are smooth, aided by bolded headings.\\nSTEP 4: The word choice is consistent and appropriate for a travel guide. The language is clear, concise, and informative. The use of descriptive adjectives, such as \"breathtaking\" and \"charming,\" enhances the appeal of the destinations.\\nSTEP 5: The use of pronouns and references is clear throughout the response. For instance, the pronoun \"it\" in the \"Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve\" section clearly refers to the reserve itself.   \n",
      "3                                            The response is mostly coherent, demonstrating a clear organizational structure by categorizing places of interest based on traveler type. The suggestions within each category are generally relevant to the respective interests. Transitions between categories are smooth, and the overall flow is easy to follow. However, there is some repetition, such as mentioning the Red Sea Coast and Luxor in multiple categories, which slightly disrupts the cohesion. Additionally, while the prompt asks for interesting places, the response focuses more on general categories of activities, which could be improved by offering more specific sites related to each activity. For instance, instead of just mentioning \"Scuba diving in the Red Sea,\" it could list a few specific diving sites. There's also some ambiguity in grouping Luxor under both \"For Culture Enthusiasts\" and \"For Relaxers.\" This makes the organization appear a little less precise. Overall, despite minor repetition and occasional lack of specificity, the response maintains a relatively good logical flow and clear structure, making it easy to understand the main points and suggestions.   \n",

The intended audience is the user.\\n\\nSTEP 2: The response starts by acknowledging the user's prompt and then proceeds to ask clarifying questions. It then provides some general suggestions for sites in England and Scotland before concluding with a friendly statement of intent to help the user. The structure is coherent, though the clarifying questions interrupt the response's flow slightly.\\n\\nSTEP 3: The individual sections are coherent, and the transitions between asking for additional information and providing general recommendations are somewhat abrupt.\\n\\nSTEP 4: The word choice is appropriate and helps the user understand the information.\\n\\nSTEP 5: Pronouns and references are clear.\\n\\nOverall, the response demonstrates good coherence in terms of organization and clarity. The abrupt transition and interruption are slight issues that make the response not entirely seamless.   \n",

The response starts by introducing the topic of ancient ruins in Greece, provides examples of famous ruins, and concludes by mentioning a few more sites. However, the overall structure could be improved with clearer thematic grouping or categorization of the ruins.\\nSTEP 3: Local coherence is inconsistent. The transitions between sentences are basic. The connection between the famous ruins mentioned and the \"many other ancient ruins\" could be strengthened. There's a missed opportunity to create a more engaging narrative flow by linking the different locations geographically or historically.\\nSTEP 4: Word choice and syntax are simple and repetitive.

While the itinerary offers a basic structure, it lacks depth in terms of details and customization options, making the overall flow somewhat disjointed.\\nSTEP 3: The transition from the initial disclaimer to the sample itinerary is abrupt. The daily descriptions are brief and lack smooth transitions, making it feel more like a list than a cohesive plan.  For example, there is no smooth way to go from Day 5's trip to Hakone, to Day 6 being back in Tokyo.\\nSTEP 4: The word choice is simple and functional. There isn't much use of descriptive language or rhetorical devices to create stronger connections between ideas. The language used is very generic for travelling.\\nSTEP 5: There are no pronoun issues, but the response lacks depth in explaining the references made (e.g., Shibuya Crossing, Harajuku). More context or details about these locations would improve clarity and coherence.   \n",

The intended audience is someone planning a trip to the region.\\nSTEP 2: The overall structure is well-organized, starting with a general introduction and then categorizing different attractions into separate bullet points. This allows for a logical flow and easy readability.\\nSTEP 3: The individual bullet points are well-structured and provide sufficient information about each attraction. The transitions between points are smooth and logical, as they are grouped thematically.\\nSTEP 4: The word choice is clear and concise, effectively conveying information about the attractions. The use of descriptive language, such as \"stunning beaches\" and \"fascinating glimpse,\" enhances the appeal.\\nSTEP 5: There are no pronouns used that could create ambiguity. Each attraction is clearly identified by name, ensuring clarity for the reader.   \n",
       "3                                                       STEP 1: The purpose of the prompt is to inquire about interesting places to visit in Egypt. The intended audience is anyone interested in travel, history, or culture, particularly those considering a trip to Egypt.\\nSTEP 2: The AI response presents a coherent list of popular tourist sites in Egypt. It starts with a general introduction and then lists specific locations with brief descriptions. The flow is logical and easy to follow.\\nSTEP 3: The response maintains local coherence by focusing on one location at a time. Each bullet point provides a concise description of the site and its significance. Transitions are smooth, mainly achieved through the consistent structure of each bullet point.\\nSTEP 4: Word choice is clear and concise, effectively conveying information about each location. The use of descriptive terms like \"iconic landmarks,\" \"giant stone statue,\" and \"masterpiece of ancient Egyptian architecture\" adds interest and provides context.\\nSTEP 5: There are no pronouns or references that cause ambiguity. Each location is clearly identified by name and location.   \n",
       "4                STEP 1: The purpose of the prompt is to request a list of historical sites in England and Scotland. The intended audience is someone planning a trip to these countries.\\nSTEP 2: The overall structure is good, with a clear division between sites in England and Scotland. The introduction and conclusion are relevant and helpful.\\nSTEP 3: Each paragraph focuses on a specific site, providing a brief description. While the information within each paragraph is coherent, the transitions between sites are basic and lack depth. For instance, simply listing sites without connecting them thematically (e.g., by historical period or architectural style) creates a sense of disjointedness. Including more sophisticated transitions would improve the flow.\\nSTEP 4: The language used is appropriate, but the descriptions are repetitive. Using synonyms and varying sentence structures would enhance cohesion. Furthermore, some connections could be strengthened. For example, the descriptions could mention how each site relates to broader historical trends or other sites.\\nSTEP 5: There are no issues with pronoun or reference clarity.   \n",
